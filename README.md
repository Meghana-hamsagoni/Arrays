Arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Arrays are one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures in computer science. An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access to elements using their index.

Key Characteristics:
	•	Fixed-size linear data structure.
	•	Stores elements of the same data type.
	•	Accessing elements is O(1) (constant time) using indexing.
	•	Useful for problems involving searching, sorting, subarrays, rearrangements, and pattern-based algorithms.

Common Operations on Arrays:
	•	Traversing and Updating Elements.
	•	Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search).
	•	Sorting (Bubble Sort, QuickSort, MergeSort).
	•	Prefix Sum & Cumulative Sum Arrays.
	•	Sliding Window Techniques.
	•	Rearranging Elements (Rotation, Partitioning).
	•	Optimized Subarray Sum Calculations (Kadane’s Algorithm).
	•	Frequency Count using HashMaps with Arrays.

Importance of Arrays:
	•	Foundation for understanding advanced data structures like Strings, HashTables, LinkedLists, and Dynamic Arrays.
	•	Frequently asked topic in coding interviews.
	•	Efficient for problems where random access and memory locality matter.
